# Final Project Proposal

## Data Processing

The data used will be gathered from Spotify web. To show, a JSON file of each artist we will explore will be downloaded. Therefore, the data processing on this assignment will combine all the JSON files and then create a .csv file or a table from them so it can be later used in the application with pandas.
Below an example of this data scraping can be seen. We get the first artist on the Top 50 USA chart, Drake. We go to his profile and gather the JSON file downloaded by the network with the artist's information.

Apart from this dataset, we will need a dataset that has the latitude and coordinates of the cities. We got this dataset from the internet.

## System Design

Compare the artist from the top charts of the countries we belong to:
-Top 50 USA -Top 50 China -Top 50 Spain -
